Description: The package is focused on finding differential exon usage
        using RNA-seq exon counts between samples with different
        experimental designs. It provides functions that allows the
        user to make the necessary statistical tests based on a model
        that uses the negative binomial distribution to estimate the
        variance between biological replicates and generalized linear
        models for testing. The package also provides functions for the
        visualization and exploration of the results.
